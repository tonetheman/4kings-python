# four kings solitaire

From my youth someone (?) taught me this card game.

There is no skill it is random chance.

- make 12 piles of 4
- you will be left with 4 cards (the draw pile)
- draw a card from the draw pile
- loop starts here
- find the pile that matches the rank
    - if you drew a 4h then you will find the 4th pile
    - place you 4h on the bottom of the pile
    - take a card from that pile
    - if you found a king (boooo)
        - set the king aside
        - get your next card from the draw pile
        - go to start of loop
    - if you did not find a king go to the start of the loop

The idea is that you want to end up with everything sorted and the 4 kings left over.

I never won that game. Not even once.

I wrote a simulation to figure out why.
